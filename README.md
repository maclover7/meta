# meta

A standard set of gem maintence and release tools for Rails and its sub-projects.

---

# Why

As Rails has grown to use more outside dependencies, it is important that incoming contributors face the same set of contributing guidelines and similar project setup.

For the details, go to [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md).

**Meta aims to provide a single and common contribution experience that all Rails sub projects should use.**
