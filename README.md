# meta

A standard set of gem maintence and release tools for Rails and its sub-projects.

---

# Why

As Rails has grown to use more outside dependencies, it is important that incoming contributors face the same set of contributing guidelines and similar project setup.

**Meta aims to provide a single set of tools that all Rails sub projects should use.**
